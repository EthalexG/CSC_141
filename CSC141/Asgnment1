Question 1: if you make a type anywhere you get an error in the code because there is specific code used in python, if you type it wrong it wont work or it will say "did you mean this?"
Question 1B: if you put a typo in the string its not gonna do anything cause the purpose of the string is to output whatever u input regardless of the text.
Question 2.  If I had infinite programming skills, I'd use them to help solve worlly problems, or code my perfect ideal game.  Does programming just mean code or does it mean rendering too? I dont know but if it just means code, Id write code that optimizes peoples computers and makes their setups run way cooler and quicker for those who dont and do have access to higher quality setups.  Id also like create maybe an virtual AI doctor, something that can help people with problems they are having or diagnose someone and since its all AI people wouldnt have to be shy about what they have going on.  I love people and want them to come together easier, I'd try to code a game like pokemon go maybe cause stuff like that really brings community together.
